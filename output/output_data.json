        "text": "CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION AND PLASMA FUNCTIONS\nI-A. Introduction\nBlood is a connective tissue fluid that circulates through the body to maintain\na constant environment around the body cells.\nBlood is the main transportation vehicle of the body; it carries O, and\nnutrients to the tissues and returns CO, to the lung and other products of\nmetabolism to the kidneys. It carries and distributes hormones and other\nagents that regulate cell functions. It functions also in regulation of body\ntemperature, acid base equilibrium and water balance.\nBlood plays a vital protective function against infection. Furthermore, injury\nto blood vessels is followed by blood clotting which stops further loss of this\nvital fluid. Thus blood helps to maintain homeostasis and to coordinate\nactivities of various organs.\nBlood is a highly complex fluid in which cellular elements are suspended. The\nfluid portion is the plasma, which forms 55% of blood volume (which averages\naround 5 litres). The cellular elements include red blood cells, white blood\ncells and platelets, and this form the remaining 45%. Blood constitutes about\n8% of body weight.\nPhysical properties of blood\n1. Colour\nArterial blood is bright red due to presence of oxyhemoglobin. Venous blood\nis dark red (bluish) due to presence of reduced hemoglobin.\n2. Viscosity\nBlood is 5 times more viscous than water. This high viscosity is due to\npresence of cells (mainly RBCs) and plasma proteins. Blood viscosity\ndecreases in cases of anemia and hypoproteinamia and increases in cases of\npolycythemia and dehydration.\nBlood viscosity is essential for maintaining normal arterial blood pressure\n(ABP) by preventing rapid flow of blood from arteries to veins.\n3. pH\nThe pH of arterial blood is 7.440.02. That of venous blood is 7.3840.02.\n4. Specific gravity\nSpecific gravity of whole blood is 1060. Specific gravity of cells is 1090, while\nthat of plasma is 1030."

Albumin, fibrinogen, prothrombin and most of alpha and beta globulins are\nformed in the liver.\n2. Gamma globulins are manufactured in the lymphoid tissues.\nPlasma proteins are continuously used by the tissues i.e. there is continuous\nturnover between proteins in the liver, plasma and tissues. They are dynamic\nand not static.\nFunctions of plasma proteins\n1. Protein metabolism\nPlasma proteins are constantly used by the tissues for their protein\nmetabolism (thus they are dynamic).\n2. Blood coagulation\nSome of the plasma proteins (the clotting factors) are needed for blood\ncoagulation. The most important of these are prothrombin and fibrinogen.\n3. Immunity\nAntibodies (gamma globulins) protect the body against pathogenic organisms\nand their toxins.\n4. Transport of important substances\nPlasma proteins function in the transport of hormones such as thyroid,\nadrenal and gonadal hormones from endocrine glands to target organs, thus\npreventing their rapid excretion through the kidney. They also serve as\ncarries for metals including iron, as well as fatty acids, amino acids,\nenzymes, drugs and carbon dioxide."

        "text": "CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION AND PLASMA FUNCTIONS\n5. Regulation of blood volume\nPlasma proteins (specially albumin) exert a colloid osmotic pressure of about 25\nmmHg. As the capillary walls are relatively impermeable to plasma proteins, this\nosmotic force tends to pullwater into the blood, thus maintaining blood volume.\n6. Buffering action\nThe plasma proteins are responsible for 15% of the buffering power of the\nblood, which helps keeping the pH of tissues almost constant. Arterial blood\nhas a pH of 7.40.02, while that of venous blood is 7.3840.02.\nProteins are present in the blood as weak acids and their salts (proteinic acid\nand sodium proteinate).\n7. Regulation of arterial blood pressure\nWhole blood is five times and plasma is two times as viscous as water. Blood\nviscosity is due to red blood cells and plasma proteins. Blood viscosity is\nresponsible partially for the peripheral resistance, which is the resistance that\nthe blood meets during its passage through the peripheral narrow blood\nvessel. It prevents the rapid outflow of blood through the vessels, thus\nmaintaining normal arterial blood pressure."

Formed blood elements\nPreparation of blood for laboratory study\n1-Blood smear (blood film)\nTo examine or count the formed blood elements, a blood smear must be\nprepared. Stains used in blood smear e.g. Giemsa's stain are designed to\ndifferentiate blood cells by their nuclei and cytoplasmic granules.\n2-Blood count\nItis the average number of a particular formed blood element per cubic\nmillimeter blood. Recently, blood count is done by an automated\nhemocytometer. Accordingly, we can perform:\n- RBCs count.\n- Total leukocytic count.\n- Platelets count.\n- Differential leukocytic count: it is the percentage of each type of leukocytes\nrelative to the total number of WBCs. It is done by counting the different types\nof leukocytes in blood smear. This count can be of diagnostic significance as\nit is associated with certain disease states.\nHistologically, blood is considered a specialized type of connective tissue.\nThe plasma represents the abundant matrix while the formed blood elements\nrepresent the cells. However, blood lacks the fibrous component of\nconnective tissue and its cells originate from the stem cells of the myeloid\ntissue present in red bone marrow.\n_IT-B. Structure of red blood corpuscles\nRed blood cells or erythrocytes (erythrum = red, cytes = cells) are so called\nbecause they are responsible for the red color of blood due to their content\nof hemoglobin.

This hemoglobin has\nbeen synthesized earlier during the process of erythrocytes formation in\nthe bone marrow.\n3- The concentration of hemoglobin at the periphery more than in the center\nof the corpuscle facilitates its binding to oxygen and carbon dioxide\ngases.\n4- The structure of the cytoskeleton helps the RBCs to be squeezed as they\npass through the narrowest blood capillaries without being damaged.\n5- The corpuscular membrane is selectively permeable to oxygen and carbon\ndioxide gases to enhance their diffusion rates during the gaseous\nexchange processes.\nII-C.

Hemoglobin binds O, to form oxyhemoglobin, O, is\nattached to the Fe (ferrous iron) in the heme. The affinity of hemoglobin for\nO, is affected by changes in pH, temperature and concentration of certain\nsubstances in the red cells.\nIf blood is exposed to various drugs and other oxidizing agents, the Fe** in the\nhemoglobin molecule is converted to ferric iron (Fe) forming methemoglobin\nwhich is uncapable of carrying O,. Carbon monoxide reacts with hemoglobin\nto form carbon monoxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobin affinity for CO is much more\nthan its affinity for O,,thus reducing the O,-Carrying capacity of blood.\nFactors affecting formation of red blood cells (erythropoiesis)\nThe formation or regeneration of red blood cells is controlled by several\nfactors that are essential for perfect red blood cells regeneration or\nerythropoiesis.\n1. Tissue oxygenation: role of erythropoietin\nAny condition that causes the quantity of O, transported to the tissues to\ndecrease ordinarily increases the rate of red cell formation. The principal\nfactor that stimulates red blood cell production is a circulating glycoprotein\nhormone called erythropoietin. Lack of O, (hypoxia) stimulates formation of\nerythropoietin. Most of the erythropoietin (90%) is formed in the kidney; the\nrest is formed mainly in the liver. Erythropoietin in turn enhances red blood\ncell production by the bone marrow until the hypoxia is relieved (Figure 4).\nErythropoietin stimulates production of proerythoblasts from haemopoietic\nstem cells in the bone marrow.!n the absence of erythropoietin, few red blood\ncells are formed by the bone marrow. On the other hand, when O, transport\nto tissues rises above normal, the rate of erythropoietin formation decreases\n(negative feedback mechanism).\n15"

However, they are not specific except erythropoietin.\nThyroxine hormones are the most powerful stimulant of body metabolism and\ntheir deficiency for long time can cause anemia. Male hormones (androgens)\nand growth hormones stimulate body metabolism and erythropoiesis.\n4. Liver\nA healthy liver is essential for normal red blood cell formation.

It results from vitamin B12 deficiency.\nAnimal food is the main dietary source of vitamin B12. After ingestion, vitamin\nB12 normally combines with the intrinsic factor (a glycoprotein secreted by\nparietal cells of the stomach). It protects vitamin B12 from digestion by\ngastrointestinal enzymes, and facilitates its absorption in the ileum. Once the\nB12- intrinsic factor complex is absorbed, the intrinsic factor is released and\nthe vitamin is transferred to the plasma. Vitamin B12 is stored in large\nquantities in the liver and is released slowly as needed by the bone marrow\nand other tissues. The normal liver can store enough vitamin B12 to meet the\nrequirements for many months.\nThe main cause of pernicious anemia is therefore defective vitamin B12\nabsorption, secondary to intrinsic factor deficiency. This occurs in cases of\ngastric mucosal atrophy, with deficiency of gastric secretions.\nCharacters of pernicious anemia\n4. Megaloblastic red celis (Figure 27-D)\n2.

It is advisable to check the action of the donors\nplasma on the recipient cells in addition, even though, as noted above, this is\nrarely a source of trouble. lf agglutination occurs in any one of the two slides\nor both, then these bloods are not compatible and blood transfusion should not\nbe performed.\nThe aim of this procedure is to detect the presence of any possible unknown\nagglutinogens that would cause transfusion reactions due to incompatibilities\nin systems other than ABO and Rh. Thus, blood should never be transfused\nwithout being cross matched except in the most extreme emergencies.\nTransfusion reactions resulting from mismatched transfusion\n1. Haemolytic transfusion reaction\nWhen one type of blood is transfused to a recipient of an incompatible blood\ntype, a haemolytic transfusion reaction is likely to occur as the red blood cells\nof the donor blood are agglutinated, haemolysed then phagocytosed by the\ntissue macrophage system where hemoglobin is released.\n52"

Hemostasis\nHemostasis means prevention of blood loss or stoppage of bleeding.\nWhenever a vessel is ruptured, hemostasis is achieved by several\nmechanisms.\nMechanisms of hemostasis\n1-Vascular spasm\nImmediately after a blood vessel is cut, the vessel wall contracts; this\nreduces blood flow from the ruptured vessel. The contraction results from:\na- nervous reflexes initiated by pain\nb- local myogenic contraction of the blood vessels\nc- humoral factors from the traumatized tissues and platelets. Platelets\nmediate much of the vasoconstriction by releasing the vasoconstrictor\nsubstances, thromboxane A2 and serotonin.\nThis local vascular spasm can last for many minutes or even hours during\nwhich the process of platelet plugging and blood coagulation can take place.\n2-Formation of the platelet plug\nWhen the receptors on the platelet membrane come in contact with damaged\nendothelium or collagen fibres in the vascular wall, the platelets immediately\nchange their shape (Figure 32). They become sticky and develop finger-like\nprocesses, so that they stick to the collagen fibres, a process called platelet\nadhesion.\nThis is followed by platelet activation. Activated platelets release the\ncontents of their dense granules, including ADP, thromboxane A2 and\nserotonin.\nThese 3 agents in turn act on nearby platelets to activate them, causing them\nto adhere to the originally activated platelets, resulting in platelet\naggregation.

Plasmin is a\nproteolyfc enzyme that digests fibrin threads and other substances in the\nclot such as prothrombin. Thus plasmin can cause complete lysis\n(dissolution) of the blood clot.\nWhen a clot is formed, plasminogen is trapped in the clot along with other\nplasma proteins. This will not cause lysis of the clot until activated. The\ninjured tissues and endothelium slowly release a powerful activator called\ntissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) that a few days later, after the clot has\nstopped the bleeding, converts plasminogen to plasmin, which removes the\nremaining unnecessary blood clot.

They include:\na. The skin constitutes a relatively impenetrable barrier to most micro-\norganisms.\nb. The mucous surfaces of the body as the conjunctiva and oral cavity are\nprotected by antibacterial substances including the enzyme lysozyme\nwhich is secreted in tears and saliva.\nc. The ciliated respiratory epithelium is protected by a layer of surface\nmucus which is continuously removed with the trapped particles.\nd. The maintenance of an acidic environment in the stomach and vagina\ninhibits the growth of pathogens in these sites.\nWhen such defenses fail, the two other types of defense mechanisms\nare activated.\n2-Non-specific immune response (innate immune system)\nInvasion of tissues by micro-organisms usually triggers a non-specific\nresponse called acute inflammation in order to remove dead tissues or\nforeign body. This type of immune response includes:\n- The complement system that mediates a wide range of inflammatory\nprocesses.\n- The phagocytic cells (tissue macrophage system).\n- Natural killer (NK) cells.\n3-Specific immune response\nThis depends on the recognition of specific antigens.
